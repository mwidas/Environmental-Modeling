a. Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation.  You can use the following formula: 

    $E = A * r * H * PR$

    * E is energy (kWh),
    * A is the solar panel area (m2)
    * r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
    * PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
    * H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)

```{r}
energy_produced <- function(panel_area, avg_solar_rad, panel_yield = 0.2, performance_ratio = 0.75){

  #compute energy from a photovoltaic system
  energy = panel_area * avg_solar_rad * panel_yield * performance_ratio 
  
  #return the result of energy calculation
  return(energy) 
}

# run the energy_produced function for a panel area of 1 m2, and average solar radiation of 2 kWh
energy_produced(1, 2)
```
